        <h1>Biografi</h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                My name is Kasper Nielsen, im a 30 years old regular guy from a semi-large town in Midtjylland called Skive. I just recently, end-January 2018 to be exact, finished my studies for the Academy Profession(AP) Degree in Computer Science at Dania campus Grenaa(specialized in video games, though we did develop other things aswell). Being a free bird so-to-speak, i am now looking for new oppertunities where i can continue to develop and hone my skills, and maybe even acuire new ones!

            </p>
            <p>
                The keen eye might have noticed that 30yo is a rather high age to attain my first degree, but safe to say, its not because i have been wasting time! I just had a little detour after i finished my International HHX(A levels equivalent, that covers business related topics, languages, maths, social sciences and other things, also it is needed for admission to University in Denmark). During this detour i have been studying the 2 higher educations Service økonom and Professionsbachelor in finances, though without completing, aswell as i have been working in quiet a few different areas(more of this on the CV page) hoping to find something that really would awaken my passion.
            </p>
            <p>It was first after returning to my hometown where i started spending time with an old school friend, who at this time was himself a Software developer, that i would find my passion. It happend after watching and talking alot about the work my friend did(often from his home with me present), where i found myself increasingingly interested, hearing about how he "invented" things out of nothing really got my interest peaked! Not long after i had my epiphany, where suddenly it striked me "why the hell did i never think to become a software developer?", i had allways been a bit of a nerd, tech-enthusiast, and was as my mom liked to call it a bit of an Ole Opfinder(Gyro Gearloose the inventor from the Donald Duck cartoon) who had to change, add or improve on everything. Me going the business route in the first place, was actually just a case of me following what everyone else did, and not wanting to waste my time while figuring out what i REALLY wanted to do. So off i went to the tech University to pursuit my new dream, and here i am today finaly having realised it, and safe to say i am SO happy about it, and i cant wait to see what the future brings(i have a ton of plans, but more about this on the Future page)! </p>

        <h2>Elon Musk</h2>
        @foreach (var item in HomeViewModel.FileList)
        {
            if (item.FileName.Contains("TheElon"))
            {
                @*<img src="logo.png">*@
                <a target="_blank" href="@item.AzureUrl"></a>
                <img src="@item.AzureUrl" alt="Image" style="width: 20%; height: 20%;" />
                break;
            }
        }
        <br />
        <p>
            Founder of Paypal, Tesla and SpaceX, this guy is a gift to the world that just keep on giving! Elon is a technological genious who works like a horse, are stubborn about making his ideas work, AND has impeccable morals unlike most(any?) top directors around the world, who actually have the power to change the world. which is the biggest factor in me respecting him so much. Elon creates what he thinks the world needs, not what he thinks he can sell, or atleast it doesnt seem to be his first priority. Or im sure he wouldnt have went into space exploration blowing up one multi billion dollar spacerocket after another with no apparent monetary gain in sight. I have no doubt in my mind that in 1-200 years, Elon will be remembered as our times Edison, Tesla or Einstein.

        <h2>Mikkel Kessler</h2>
        @foreach (var item in HomeViewModel.FileList)
        {
            if (item.FileName.Contains("TheKessler"))
            {
                @*<img src="logo.png">*@
                <a target="_blank" href="@item.AzureUrl"></a>
                <img src="@item.AzureUrl" alt="Image" style="width: 20%; height: 20%;" />
                <p><i>Joe Calzaghe, Mikkels biggest opponent to date and Mikkel having a stare-off. These guys are great friends outside of the ring even to this day, despite having to brawl it out against eachother. Allegedly they enjoy meeting up for a match of table tennis when visiting eachothers countries, truely honorable guys!</i></p>
                break;
            }
        }
        <p>
            Having played a ton of sports myself, and having competed in many Badminton tournaments, i really appreciate sports and acknowledge the importance our sports-stars have on our society. This is especially true among our youth who look up to them and want to follow in their footsteps. And in sport, in my eyes there are no better example to follow than Denmarks biggest boxer ever the multiple-world champion boxer Mikkel Kessler, most honorable sportsman i ever saw, a true champ.
        </p>   <br />
        <h2>Jordan B Peterson</h2>
        @foreach (var item in HomeViewModel.FileList)
        {
            if (item.FileName.Contains("ThePeterson"))
            {
                @*<img src="logo.png">*@
                <a target="_blank" href="@item.AzureUrl"></a>

                break;
            }
        }
        <p>
            Canadian professor of Psychology aswell as clinical psychologist for more than 20 years. Jordan is very active on his youtube channel, where he has lectures about pretty much all aspects of life, generally teaching people how to become the best person we can possible be(from which i have learned alot!). He is an extremely intelligent man, and rather entertaining aswell which i suspect is not common for people with that kind of intellect.
